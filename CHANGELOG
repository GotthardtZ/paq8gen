paq8gen_v1 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2021.01.02
- Forked form paq8px_v200 (https://github.com/hxim/paq8px)
- Removed most models except MatchModel, NormalModel, WordModel, DMCForect/DMCModel, LSTMModel
- Removed most transformations except EOL
- Removed most detections except Text
- Removed all pre-training
- Removed most command line options except Adaptive Learning Rate (A), LSTM model (L)
- Removed some NormalModel mixer contexts, removed the fast order 1 model
- Renamed WordModel to LineModel, removed all contexts except some linemodel ones
- Increased NormalModel contexts from 14->24
- Increased MatchModel minimum match length: 5->16, stepsize: 2->8
- Tuned mixer scaling factor: 940, 80 -> 2048, 256


paq8gen_v2 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2021.01.02
- Added 10 contexts and 2 mixer context sets to LineModel


paq8gen_v3 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2021.01.31
- Removed LSTM model, DMCForest, SmallStationaryContextMap, Adaptive Learning Rate
- Removed unused functions from utils.hpp
- Imported LargeStationaryMap, MatchModel, IndirectContext changes from (a pre-relase of) paq8px
- Replaced the 12-bit Arithemtic Encoder with a new high precision one
- New APM: "APMPost" to support the new Arithmetic Encoder with higher precision probability
- Cleaned up NormalModel, refined some contexts
- Cleaned up SSE stage and Shared
- Tweaks, cosmetic changes


paq8gen_v4 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2021.02.07
- Small tweaks in MormalModel, LineModel and MatchModel
- Small tweak in APMPost: decreased a-priory counts
- Small tweak in SSE stage: using two APMPost maps
- Tweaked model memory use
- Tweaked mixer scaling


paq8gen_v5 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2021.02.20
- Simplified replacement strategy in Bucket16
- Decreased final learning rate from 8 to 6 in last mixer layer
- Removed IndirectContext and LargeIndirectContext
- Refined SSE stage: now using 4 high precision APMPost maps instead of 2
- Removed not useful contexts from LineModel, added contexts to better model codons
- Removed not useful contexts form MatchModel, added context to identify ambiguous matches; now using initial match lengths of multiple of 3
- Cosmetic changes in NormalModel and Shared

paq8gen_v6 by Andrew Epstein
2021.02.21
- Cosmetic changes in various places, e.g. removing unneeded `const`
- Added compile option CHALLENGE, which will build a size-optimized executable
- No compression changes
